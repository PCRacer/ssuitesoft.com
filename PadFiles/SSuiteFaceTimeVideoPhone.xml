FaceTime Video phone does not rely on third-party vendors or special internet websites to make calls. There is no need for registration, account information, or any personal information on your part to make this application work.

All you need is a headset, microphone, and / or a web camera to make a call. FaceTime works only on LAN, DSL, Cable, or 3 / 4G broadband connections. The minimum bandwidth required is 128 Kbps (continuous - upstream and downstream).

How it works:

Before making a call, press the refresh button to make sure of your I.P. Address. When making a call over a DSL, Cable, or 3 / 4G connection, connect first and then run the application to ensure a correct return I.P. Address.

On a LAN connection the I.P. Address is your network card address. On a DSL, Cable, or 3 / 4G  connection, the I.P. Address is the address your I.S.P. provides automatically when you connect.

To make a quick connection to a friend or family member, simply sms your current I.P. address to whom ever you need to contact while you are online. They in turn enter your I.P. address in the address box and click on the chat button to start the connection. 

When connected, you have the choice to go to Video by clicking on the "Video" button and then clicking on the play button to start your video conversation.

You are able to open the video window without being connected to have a self preview to setup your web camera for best results. Just press play to view yourself on the main screen. Just make sure your IP address to call is 127.0.0.1 when pressing play.

Please Note: SSuite FaceTime is also completely compatible with all our other p2p communications software.

Please read the "Read Me" file included with this installation.
