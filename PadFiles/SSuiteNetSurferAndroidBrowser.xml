It has the best performance and display speed possible since there is no overhead, personal data collection, link tracking, or any lag present!

Our browser has a specially designed proprietary easy-to-use graphical user interface and runs without data collection and tracking from Google and BigTech.

We have created two editions of NetSurfer for Android to accommodate the two mobile devices most used when surfing the web, that is tablets and smartphones. These two apps run on the most popular browser engine on Android, namely Chrome, which is already installed on every Android smartphone, smart television, and tablet.

Exceptions found in both Android editions:

- There is no extension support due to security concerns!
- There is No ability to open or save documents when using our online productivity web apps, as yet.

Special Features Found in NetSurfer:

Our browser has sandboxed tabs with multi-threaded file download support for fast and convenient interaction while surfing the net. Passwords are saved automatically for login purposes and will allow you to enter websites without the need to re-enter your personal data when accessing your favourite online accounts.

Our smartphone edition is for phones up to 7" in size or with a screen size of 360x740 or larger. Our tablet edition is for tablets that are 8" in size or more, and televisions with a minimum screen size of 1024x768 or larger.
