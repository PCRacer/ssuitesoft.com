SSuite WordGraph portable is a free and very useful alternative to Microsoft's Word, OpenOffice's Writer, or anything else out there claiming to be the latest and greatest. You don't even have a need for .NET or even JAVA to be installed. This will save you a lot of hard drive space and precious computer resources.</Char_Desc_450><Char_Desc_2000>SSuite WordGraph portable is a comprehensive and reliable word processor designed to help you create and edit written documents, providing you with the ability to insert images and several other elements.

Simple-to-use environment:

The program is fairly simple to run and handle, featuring a user-friendly and intuitive interface, with an extensive toolbar and multiple menus you can use. Also, it can work with multiple tabs, so you can switch back and forth between several open documents, copying and pasting fragments.

Extensions you can use

When opening a one-page file, you can choose between multiple layouts, such as Landscape,  Portrait, A4, Letter, Legal and others. In the case of documents containing numerous pages, you can preview them in the left side and click on specific one to open it.

Insert pictures, use rulers and add symbols:

The main window of the utility features left and right rulers, enabling you to easily estimate the dimensions of the objects you insert, like pictures; you can even add an image from a scanning device or other capturing software.

SSuite WordGraph features numerous fonts, as well as a wide array of special characters and symbols which you can insert in your documents. The tool includes the ability to choose the preferred alignment style, bullets, formatting styles (underline, italics, bold etc.), or insert the current date.

Check your spelling, save files as templates, and search for an item:

A spell checker is put at your disposal, as well as several emoticons, an equation builder and word counter, while it is also possible to use an integrated translation engine and add custom phrases to a list so that you can use them at a later date.

Last but not least, you can easily save items to a built-in document template library, use a search function, as well as a find and replace one.
