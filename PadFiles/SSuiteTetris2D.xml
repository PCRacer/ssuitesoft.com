A random sequence of Tetris blocks fall down the playing field (a rectangular vertical shaft, called the "well" or "matrix"). The objective of the game is to manipulate these Tetris shapes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of ten blocks without gaps.

When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. When a certain number of lines are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the Tetris shapes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of Tetris shapes reaches the top of the playing field and no new Tetris blocks are able to enter. SSuite Tetris 2D ends after 13 levels are played.

You are also able to select the difficulty level before game play. Enjoy hours of fun with our free Tetris 2D game...

This game is also completely and absolutely portable!
