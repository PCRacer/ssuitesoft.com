This application uses direct Peer-To-Peer FTP(File Transport Protocol) communications for data transfers over your local Wi-Fi network.

Any local wireless network your smartphone is connected to may be used for data transfer. All devices with an IPv4 address that are connected to your local Wi-Fi network are able to send or receive files with SSuite PC-Drop. There is NO need for an internet connection or any registered cloud account for background syncing of data between devices.

There are two applications available for download. There is the Android app file (APK) and then there is the Windows WIN32 executable program in 32bit and 64bit versions.

Simply unzip the file and copy and paste them wherever you find best. SSuite PC-Drop uses the standard Android "Documents Folder" as the default folder to send and receive files from.

On your Windows system the program uses your "Public Documents" folder to send and receive files from. For user-friendliness operation, simplicity, and security reasons, the file paths are not allowed to be changed, this will ensure that you know where the files are being sent or received to.

Quick Tip!

If you don't know your smartphone's IP address, simply send a file, any small file, from your smartphone to your Windows PC running the Windows edition of PCDrop. The sent file will enable to show your smartphone's IP address in the sender's IP address editbox of the Windows edition of PCDrop.

When running the Windows edition of PCDrop, the program will automatically show your Windows PC's IP address on the top center of the program's window. Send your file to that address for a quick reminder what your smartphone's IP address is.
