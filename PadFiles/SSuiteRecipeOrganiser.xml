Cookbooks are kind of old-fashioned and have a number of disadvantages. For example they can't be easily edited, searched or shared online. What's more, they tend to become damaged and worn as time goes by. SSuite Recipe Organiser can help overcome some of the traditional cookbook's limitations by providing a simple, intuitive database to help store recipes.

Easy to organize and search:

The main window of the application features two resizable tabs and a number of conveniently placed buttons which allow users to create and view categories or search for recipes. A comprehensive print preview feature is also available to print all your recipes.

Functional built-in text editor:

Recipes are entered or modified by using the full featured built-in text editor. One can also import recipes or text from TXT and RTF files. Drag and drop is also supported directly from any other application or web browser.

As an extra feature, the editor can also handle conversions between various units of mass and volume that may be encountered in the kitchen such as grams, millilitres, cups, ounces and pints.

This application may also be used as a general database for any other subject or field of data collection.
