Reduce travel costs and spend less on third-party conferencing tools. SSuite's communication sidebar helps people save time and money by providing one-click communication through our unified video communications technology, and real-time document sharing using the file portal.

This makes virtual meetings more effective so users can get more done without being in the same room, city, or even country. You can simultaneously experience multiple modes of communication, including video conferencing, telephony, and instant file transfer.

How it works: For LAN and Wi-Fi connections, simply enter the I.P. address or Host name you want to call and click on the "Chat" button. When the ringtone goes off, just answer your call and start chatting, with or without video.

If you are behind a router, take a look at our tutorial on Video setup for best results. You will need to enter setup information to do Port forwarding on your router. To make a quick connection to a friend or family member over the internet, simply sms your current I.P. address to whom ever you  need to contact while you are online.

They in turn enter your I.P. address in the address box and click on the chat button to start the connection. Answer the call and start chatting with or without video. 

Recommended codecs for best video performance - RGB 24, i420, YUY2.  Don't use mpeg codecs, they are not supported!

Compatible Screen Sizes: 1280x1024  |  1600x1200  |  1650x1050  |  1680x1050  |  1920x1080 or more...
