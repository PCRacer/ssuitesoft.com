People love their privacy and will do everything possible to protect their messaging and communications from being intercepted, whether they are from governments or unscrupulous hackers. Now with SSuite NetVine you are able to go completely and absolutely off-line from the internet to continue having private chats and email with everyone sharing any local area network that is connected to you{LAN and Wi-Fi}.

We have included everything except the kitchen sink... there is instant messaging for quick chats and responses, quick text, voicemail, server-less email for formal communications, and even a fast file and document transfer portal for true collaboration. There is also a desktop version available for download, try the second download link on this page.

Another advantage of going off-line is that it will save you a bundle in online data costs as you will be using the infrastructure that is already there and usually completely under-used. It does not cost you a cent to use your own local area network to communicate with others that are connected to it.

All you need is the right tool to get the ball rolling and that can only happen with SSuite NetVine. There is no setup necessary as it is completely server-less.

SSuite NetVine is perfect for any home, home office, and even business office network environment. Get talking, communicating, and document sharing in no time fast and secure over your OWN LAN or Wi-Fi network!
