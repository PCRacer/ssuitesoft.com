SSuite Mac Dock sports its very own shortcuts to some of the most popular applications on the market e.g. MS Office, FireFox etc. This dock may also be found in some of our premium office suites like Excalibur and The Fifth Element.

You will also have direct system access through the dock's sub menus{sub-docks}. Up to 44 custom application short-cuts may be added to the dock for easier and faster start-up of your most favourite programs. The Mac Dock sits at the bottom of your screen/desktop for best user performance and cannot be moved.

To access the custom settings, simply right-click on the dock, and make your selections. It also supports auto-hide, recycle bin, and transparency options. To delete files, simply drag and drop them onto the "recycle bin" or "trash can" of the dock. Most of the individual SSuite applications that can run from the Mac Dock, may be downloaded from our website's download page for best user experience.

Running Instructions:

To run the Mac Dock, simply drag your Windows taskbar to the top or sides of your screen and run the Mac dock executable. For easier operation, simply add a short-cut to the application in your "Startup" folder.

Possible Side-Effect with Windows 7 / 8 / 10 / 11 and beyond...

If you only have Windows Defender or Security Essentials running, open the application and click on the last tab named "Settings". In the list displayed on the left-hand side, select the process exceptions and add "Desktop.exe" to the list of processes exempt of scanning. This will enable an instant start-up of the Mac dock when loading application short-cut and icons onto the dock.
