   Typically you are getting this because you sent someone an email
message using MS-Word or some other operating system or
text-processing specific attachment.  Alternatively, you may
have placed MS-Word files on the web as the only means for getting at
the document content.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.1">
1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Requires proprietary software</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You are basically assuming that everyone has on their desktop the same
software that you have.  That often goes against the spirit of the
Internet which is supposed to be about inter-operability of
heterogeneous systems.  That fact that one "persistently predatory
monopoly"<a href="http://goldmark.org/netrants/no-word/attach.html#tthFtNtAAB" name="tthFrefAAB"><sup>1</sup></a> attempts to
subvert that goal, doesn't mean that you should go along with it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Someone who sends me such mail is perfectly welcome to purchase for me
a machine and software specifically so that I can read mail in that
proprietary system.  But I will still have the inconvenience of having
to forward the file to a system I wouldn't normally use.

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.2">

1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Version problems</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Even for those who chose to use MS-Word, there are compatibility
problems between various versions.  Foreshadowing the next topic, it
appears that Microsoft is unwilling to provide fixes for very
substantial security problems in older versions.
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/ptech/09/13/microsoft.word.bug.ap/index.html">An
  article on CNN's website</a> (September 13, 2002) reports such an
instance.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.3">
1.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Proprietary data format</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

The above two problems are closely tied to the question of proprietary
data formats.  When you store your work in MS-Word format, you are
betting that you will always have access to some licensed software that
will be able to read that format.  The <a href="http://odfi.org/">Open Data
Format Initiative</a> has more information on what is wrong with closed
formats.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.4">
1.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Viruses and security</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
MS-Word allows full macro-scripting.  It is now the most common
carrier for viruses.  What this means is that embedded within a Word
file can be a program which runs silently (or otherwise) on the
recipient's computer whenever they view the file.  Are you happy with
letting other people run programs on your machine?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In one instance that I know of, a substantial portion of an MBA
graduating class sent out r&#233;sum&#233;s with a Word macro virus.  I
don't think that this helped their job prospects.  But the particular
business school had an official MS-Word policy.


<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.5">
1.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Size</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Often what would be just a few kilobytes of plain text is hundreds of
kilobytes as a Word file.  I find it interesting that MS-file browsers
and emailers don't make it obvious to the sender how large particular
files are.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.6">
1.6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior version info</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

Because of Word's system of doing version control, it is possible that
recipients may see prior drafts of your document (which may contain
confidential information).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've heard a number of "friend of a friend" stories about this sort
of thing.  In one case, a potential customer was given a quote for
some product, and the quote was sent in an MS-Word file.  When the
customer viewed the version history, they found that a previous
version of the document had been used for a quote to other customers,
with much lower numbers.  But since initially writing this, I have
heard a number of first hand accounts.  Some of which are below.
Since I almost never read MS-Word documents sent to me, I will have to
rely on the accounts of others.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Probably one of the most spectacular instances of information
inadvertently leaked because someone (the British Prime Minister's
office) used MS-Word for document exchange is described in an article by
Richard M. Smith,
<i><a href="http://www.computerbytesman.com/privacy/blair.htm">Microsoft
Word bytes Tony Blair in the butt</a></i>.  The edit history of the "February
dossier" has become a matter of contention to say the least.  Smith's
article provides links and details.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Other, more mundane, accounts of meta-data leaking from MS-Word documents
follow.

  news article</a>,

Alan Frame describes some of his experiences with this

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<blockquote>  In the past, I've received MS Word documents from an agency,
  describing a job vacancy where they've refused to name the client -
  lo and behold, the document properties reveals all.

</blockquote>
And also

<blockquote>
  Indeed, I've also seen an internal business proposal which appears
  to have originated at the supplier that the proponent was err,
  proposing.
</blockquote>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have also received word from others saying,

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<blockquote>  This regularly happens to me because I deal with public relations
  companies who always use the very latest spiffy version of Word and
  Powerpoint and seem to be totally unaware that not everyone does the
  same.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  Normally I junk these docs, but if I need them I view them ... and
  often see where corrections have been made...

<div class="p"><!----></div>

  I have never seen anything really sensitive as a result of this,
  probably because most press releases aren't on very sensitive
  subjects.  Usually I see comments like "CLAIRE: should we describe
  what the possible treatment options might be?", plus minor
  word-changes. But I live in hope.
</blockquote>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Charles Wankel posted a message concerning this to the
<a href="http://www.aom.pace.edu:81/guest/RemoteListSummary/emedia_l">E-Media
  list</a> of the <a href="http://www.aom.pace.edu/">Academy of Management</a>
saying,

<blockquote>  I received a paper for an effort that I was an editor for from
  someone who had used a ghostwriter.  The ghostwriter had had
  embedded her name in such a way that when I looked at the document

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.7">
1.7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically attached "wrong" to email</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While this is not strictly speaking a problem with MS-Word files, it
is a related problem.  People and systems that think that it is right
to just send such things, seem to think that it is OK to send
everything with the MIME Content-type of
<tt>application/octet-stream</tt> and let the recipient work things
out from the filename info that is also sent.  That is a violation of
the intent of the MIME standards, and indicates broken design for
exchange of information.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.8">
1.8</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Word is not device independent</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have been told that MS-Word documents will format differently
depending on the specifics of the printer.  This is not merely issues
of printer resolution or color depth, but the actual formating of the
document will differ.  I was surprised to learn this.  I had assumed
that Word was "What You See Is What You Get", but it appears that I
was mistaken about that.  So it won't even achieve the goal of
ensuring that your recipient sees things with all the formatting you
see things with even if the recipient also uses MS-Word.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.9">
1.9</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Word isn't even good at what it is designed for</h3><a name="sec:wordsucks">
</a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As an aside, I feel that MS-Word produces probably the worst output
and is the slowest and most tedious to work in of any document
preparation system in serious use I've seen in the past 15 years.  I
find it remarkable that when people are presented a choice between a
structural mark-up system (what you mean is what get) versus a visual
mark-up system (what you see is all you get) people opt for the
latter.  For more on this point see section&nbsp;<a href="http://goldmark.org/netrants/no-word/attach.html#sec:wordrants">5.2</a>.  Note
that the argument that MS-Word is an inappropriate exchange format
is independent of this point about its quality as a document
preparation system.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">

2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatives</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When talking about things sent by email it is important to distinguish
between document exchange and message exchange.  Message exchange is
typically what one does by email.  Making announcements or
participating in a discussion, and many of the other things we
typically do with email.  For these plain text is the only reasonable
thing.  It is the safest, most portable and by far the most compact.
It allows responses quoting portions, and has none of the dangers
mentioned above.  The small added value of the formating information
isn't worth all of the problems.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you absolutely <em>need</em> to present the formating information for
document exchange, then use a page description language like PDF.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also consider using (standards compliant) HTML.  Please note that I
am not in any way advocating the use of HTML in ordinary email.  It is
grossly inappropriate for that for reasons that are beyond the scope
of this document.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In earlier versions of this document, I listed RTF (Rich Text Format) as
a more standards based way of exchanging word-processor documents.  I
have been corrected on that point innumerable times.  RTF is little
better than MS-Word format itself.  It is a &lt;em&#62;little&lt;/em&#62; better, but
it shares all of the problems as MS-Word.  Although RTF was advertised as
a document exchange format, it never lived up to that.  It appears to
have varying features, and the various version of RTF that Microsoft products
create have elements which only Microsoft Products can read.  Note that
this is not because MS-Word is a better product, but because Microsoft
keeps elements of what it considers to be RTF secret.


<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where MS-Word is appropriate</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
MS-Word is appropriate for document exchange among co-authors of a
document who are all developing it and have agreed before hand to use
MS-Word.  If you have been referred to the document you are now reading,
then the person who referred you to it probably doesn't consider
themselves party to such an agreement, and having sent them an MS-Word
document is inappropriate.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc4">
4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Response to the "it's the emergent standard" refrain</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

Several people have responded with sophisticated "network analysis"
essays about MS-Word being a <em>de facto</em> standard, and pointing out that
even if the standard isn't the optimal one, it is better to go along
with the standard anyway.  My counter argument is two-fold:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ol type="1">
<li> Whether or not the argument about emergent standard holds for
  authorship (eg, "I use Word because it is what my potential
  co-authors use") has little bearing on what you use for document
  exchange.  I use <span class="roman">L</span><sup><span class="roman">A</span></sup><span class="roman">T</span><sub><span class="roman">E</span></sub><span class="roman">X</span>&nbsp;for document preparation, but I distribute
  them as PDF.<a href="http://goldmark.org/netrants/no-word/attach.html#tthFtNtAAC" name="tthFrefAAC"><sup>2</sup></a>  So there <em>may</em> be
  an argument for using MS-Word even though it is inferior to other
  options, but that in no way suggests that MS-Word should be used for
  document exchange.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> The second argument is an ethical one, and I start with an
  analogy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  Over the past few years it has become fashionable in the
  US to drive some form of truck as a primary commuting/errands
  vehicle.  There are many issues regarding that fashion, but for this
  analogy I would like to focus on two of them.  When two vehicles
  collide the occupants of the lighter one are far more likely to
  suffer injury than they would if the had collided with an equally
  light vehicle.  So when someone drives a truck, they are
  putting those in normal sized vehicles at an extra risk.  The second
  property is similar.  The headlights of the trucks are much higher
  off the ground than those of cars.  Driving a car at night with one
  of these trucks close behind you is extremely annoying and possibly
  dangerous.  In both of these cases, the drivers of the trucks don't
  experience the disadvantage of others driving trucks.  In the first
  case, they too are in heavy vehicles, and in the second the driver
  is high enough off the ground to not be impaired by the headlights
  of other trucks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  By the logic of the "emergent standard" advocates, the only way to
  deal with the truck problems I've described is to switch to driving
  a truck oneself.  The emergent standard argument might have some
  validity if the standards were arbitrary, but if some are
  particularly destructive to community as a whole, they should be
  opposed.  Use of MS-Word for document exchange is simply bad network
  citizenship.  Paraphrasing Juhapekka Tolvanen: using MS-Word is like
  smoking; using it for document exchange is like blowing your smoke
  in everyone else's face.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> There is a third argument, closely related to the second: Do you
  want to be part of Microsoft's marketing effort?
<div class="p"><!----></div>

</li>
</ol>

When I first wrote the first version of this document in March, 2001,
it was because I not only was fed up with people sending me unwanted
MS-Word documents, but because I was tired of explaining repeatedly
why I objected to them.  I wrote this to be part of a canned
response.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Being remarkably lazy, I didn't want to investigate and write this up
if someone else had already written something.  So I did a little bit
of searching for documents like this.  I knew from personal
communication that while I am in a minority there is a substantial
minority which feels exactly the same way.  I expected that someone
would have already written something like this document.

I didn't find any when I looked, but clearly I didn't look carefully
enough.  I have since been informed of others that I've missed.  I

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The focus of this document has been on the misuse of Word for document
exchange.  It is geared toward  MS-Word users to encourage them to send
documents in other formats, even if they continue to use Word for
document production.  It should be noted, however, that those
individuals who are most annoyed by receiving MS-Word files for
document exchange are those who do not regularly use MS-Word.  None
the less, it is hoped that fans of MS-Word will recognize that
whatever its virtues, it is not a document exchange format.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

The arguments I've presented stand even if MS-Word were a good tool
for document preparation.  However, I'd also like to point to some
documents which argue (correctly in my view) why MS-Word is a bad
choice of document preparation system and not just a bad choice of
document exchange format.

5.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaction so far</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

As far as I can tell my campaign has met with little success so far
(January 2002) other than a few people taking some care to send me RTF
documents instead of MS-Word documents, with no change in their
general practice.  If I get any response at all it is typically
"Well, you're right but I'm going to stick with my current
practices."  I find that disappointing, particularly when people
acknowledge the correctness of the ethical argument I make.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On September 13, 2002 an opportunity fell into my lap during a
discussion of a newly reported security bug in MS-Word to shamelessly
plug this document in
<a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=39860&cid=4252157"><tt>http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=39860&amp;cid=4252157</tt></a>.
This generated a number of supportive email messages and a flurry of
typo corrections.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There has also been one, somewhat harsh, critique of version&nbsp;1.27 of
this document.  That critique and brief discussion can be found at
<a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=39860&cid=4264355"><tt>http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=39860&amp;cid=4264355</tt></a>.  I have
modified the wording of section&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090214223045/http://goldmark.org/netrants/no-word/attach.html#sec:wordsucks">1.9</a> and further
emphasized the point made at the beginning of
section&nbsp;<a href="http://goldmark.org/netrants/no-word/attach.html#sec:wordrants">5.2</a> as a result.
